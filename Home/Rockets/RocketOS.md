### Analysis
Using [[Quaternions]] for 3d orientation. Main GNC with [[PID]], going to be changed to state space control. Sensor filtering with a [[Kalman Filter]]. Small [[Aerodynamics]] integration with custom C++ library with python inspiration. however could be possibly done in a seperate program.
