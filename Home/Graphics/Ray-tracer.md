# Ray-tracer

### Summary
Lightweight C++ application using raytracing to display images on screen. Possible future versions will use a graphics API to render directly to the screen. Currently the pipeline is Application -> PPM File -> GIMP (for viewing).

### Design / Analysis
Cameras
Ray-Object Intersections → Where the ray intersects with a given object
Light Sources ->
Visibility ->
Surface Scattering ->
Indirect Light Transport ->
_Ray Propagation_ → What happens to the light traveling along the ray
